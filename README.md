# Market Segmentation with K-Means

This repository demonstrates how to perform **market segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** in Python.  
It includes a sample dataset and a Jupyter notebook with code for preprocessing, applying clustering, and interpreting results.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **Example-Data.csv**  
  The dataset used for clustering (e.g., customer attributes, spending patterns, or demographic features).

- **Market-Segmentation_K-Means.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter notebook that walks through the segmentation process step by step:
  - Data loading & exploration
  - Data preprocessing (scaling, cleaning)
  - Applying **K-Means clustering**
  - Choosing optimal number of clusters (Elbow method, Silhouette score)
  - Visualizing results
  - Interpreting customer segments
